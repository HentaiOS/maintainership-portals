2. MUST UPLOAD
All device sources used for building the image on the hentaiOS-Devices Organization. it goes without saying that these should be fully buildable. Using external repositories aren't allowed unless it's coming from LineageOS or Sony Open Devices Project (SODP).

4. MUST have conducted internal tests before pushing OTA Updates to users. Each build has to thoroughly checked by the maintainer and all hardware and software functionality MUST be tested before the build is pushed to production.

5. MUST maintain authorship of Git commits that are pushed. These are mandatory requirements for ALL repositories, Force-pushes are acceptable.

6. In the event of any disagreements between maintainers, sort them via Direct Messages on Telegram or XDA, don't take any of that into chats or threads, approach the Internal Boards if you want something sorted out quickly.

7. MUST NOT add any of the following:

    - Any features in their device-specific packages, e.g XiaomiParts, KCAL, Camera API2 Enforcement, etcetera, in an exception if that feature is available on stock firmware, e.g Alert Slider and Offscreen Gestures for OnePlus Devices, Fingerprint Gestures, Dirac Sound, or any Audio Enhancer that's part of stock firmware, otherwise, it can't be shipped.

8. In case of A/B or Dynamic Partitioned devices, you MUST NOT ship TWRP prebuilt, it MUST ship AOSP Recovery.
